/**
 * v3 runtime ⇄ ephemeral-pool IPC contract.
 *
 * This is the SHARED boundary between the two halves of the v3 engine:
 *   - scheduling / persistence side (claude): `runtime.ts` calls `runNode`,
 *     consumes the returned manifest, writes the next node's `inputs.json`.
 *   - execution / IPC side (codex): `ephemeral-pool.ts` implements `runNode`
 *     (spawns a throwaway worker in goal-mode), `manifest.ts` implements the
 *     `Manifest` validator.
 *
 * Both sides import the *types* from here so the contract can't silently drift.
 * Implementations live in their owners' files; this module is types + frozen
 * string constants only (no runtime logic).  See
 * `docs/design/2026-06-01-v3-mvp-engine-split.md` §2 for prose.
